<h2><strong>NiteHush Pro Ingredients (scientifically backed)</strong></h2>
<p>The effectiveness of NiteHush Pro is rooted in its scientifically-backed ingredients. Let&rsquo;s thoroughly examine the evidence supporting each key component and how they contribute to the claimed benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Ivy Extract</strong> &ndash; Clears Mucus &amp; Opens Nasal Passages: Ivy Extract, sourced from the Hedera helix plant, acts as a natural expectorant to clear mucus from the throat and nasal passages. This promotes clear airflow and reduces nighttime congestion, a common cause of snoring. With its anti-inflammatory benefits, Ivy Extract soothes irritated throat tissues, making it easier to breathe freely and sleep soundly.</p>
<p><strong>Serratiopeptidase</strong> &ndash; Alleviates Inflammation for Better Breathing: Serratiopeptidase is a powerful enzyme that breaks down protein buildup and reduces swelling in the airways. By minimizing inflammation in the upper respiratory tract, it prevents throat obstruction and promotes optimal oxygen intake. This helps you achieve deeper sleep cycles and wake up feeling refreshed and energized.</p>
<p><strong>Liposomal Quercetin</strong> &ndash; Supports Clear Airflow &amp; Combats Irritation: Liposomal Quercetin is a highly absorbable antioxidant that fights inflammation and oxidative stress in the airways. Its advanced formulation ensures maximum bioavailability, keeping the throat and nasal passages clear. By supporting the immune system and reducing airway irritation, Liposomal Quercetin contributes to smoother breathing and uninterrupted sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Glucoraphanin</strong> &ndash; Detoxifies &amp; Strengthens Respiratory Health: Glucoraphanin, a natural compound found in cruciferous vegetables, plays a vital role in detoxifying the body and reducing oxidative stress. It protects respiratory cells, minimizes inflammation, and improves airflow, helping to prevent snoring-related breathing obstructions. This ingredient ensures your body functions optimally, leading to deeper, more restorative sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Naringin</strong> &ndash; Promotes Relaxed Breathing &amp; Soothes the Throat: Naringin, a bioflavonoid found in grapefruits, delivers powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits. It reduces throat irritation, boosts circulation, and prevents airway constriction, ensuring clearer breathing and snore-free nights. By supporting lung function and oxygen distribution, Naringin helps you enjoy a rejuvenating sleep experience.</p>
<p><strong>Citrus Hesperidin</strong> &ndash; Improves Blood Flow &amp; Supports Easy Breathing: Citrus Hesperidin, a bioflavonoid derived from citrus fruits, is a key ingredient in NiteHush Pro. Known for its anti-inflammatory and circulation-boosting properties, it enhances blood flow to the respiratory system, ensuring smooth, uninterrupted breathing. By strengthening blood vessels and reducing airway constriction, Citrus Hesperidin helps minimize snoring and supports better sleep quality.</p>
